  /**
   * You are given an array S consisting of N strings. Every string is of the same length M. Your
   * task is to find a pair of strings in array S, such that there exists a position in which both
   * of the strings have the same letter. Both the index in array S and the positions in the strings
   * are numbered from zero.
   *
   * For example, given S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"], string 0 ("abc") and string 2 ("dbe") have the
   * same letter 'b' in position 1. On the other hand, for strings "abc" and "bca" there does not
   * exist a position in which they have the same letter.
   *
   * Write a function:
   *
   * class Solution { public int[] solution(String[] S); }
   *
   * that, given a zero-indexed array S of N strings, returns an array describing a pair of strings
   * from S which share a common letter at some index. If there is no such pair, the function should
   * return an empty array. If there is more than one correct answer, the function can return any of
   * them.
   *
   * The result should be represented as an array containing three integers. The first two integers
   * are the indexes in S of the strings belonging to the pair. The third integer is the position of
   * the common letter.
   *
   * For S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"], as above, the result array should be represented as [0, 2, 1].
   * Another correct answer is [2, 0, 1], as the order of indexes of strings does not matter.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * 1. Given: S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"], your function may return [0, 2, 1] as described above.
   *
   * 2. Given: S = ["zzzz", "ferz", "zdsr", "fgtd"], your function may return [0, 1, 3]. Both "zzzz"
   * and "ferz" have 'z' in position 3. The function may also return [1, 3, 0], which would reflect
   * strings "ferz", "fgtd" and letter 'f'.
   *
   * 3. Given A = ["gr", "sd", "rg"], your function should return []. There is no pair of strings
   * that fulfils the criteria.
   *
   * 4. Given A = ["bdafg", "ceagi"], your function may return [0, 1, 2].
   *
   * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
   *
   * N is an integer within the range [1..30,000]; M is an integer within the range [1..2,000]; each
   * element of S consists only of lowercase English letters (a-z); N * M â‰¤ 30,000.
