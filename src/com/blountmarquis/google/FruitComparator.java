/**
 * Created by MLBlount on 9/17/2015.
 *
 * I've made a modification to my proposed solution. During the interview I saved a List of FruitType this
 * created the need to traverse the list in compare to determine the indices of fruit1's FruitTYpe and fruit2's
 * FruitType. This caused our compare method to have O(n) complexity. Instead of storing a List of FruitType a better
 * solution would be to store a Map. The constructor would need to populate our Map, the Map would save the FruitType as
 * a key and the index as a value. although this is also an O(n) operation we will only need to do it once and compare
 * method is now contant. VS the intial solution which was an O(N) compare. which will be caused multiple times.
